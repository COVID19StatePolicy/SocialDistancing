# _Archived documentation_

_Also see above pdf files for more recent documentation archives_

## State-level policy response:
- **File**: "USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv". Prior datasets are archived with date stamps in the format of YYYYMMDD.
- **location_id**: State-level unique identifier per the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.  
- **StateFIPS**: State-level Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code.    
- **StatePostal**: Two-letter state postal code.  
- **StateName**: State name.  
- **StatePolicy** : String variable of state policies, as described below:   
      - **EmergDec**: Emergency declaration; currently includes State of Emergency, Public Health Emergency, and Public Health Disaster declarations.     
      - **GathRecom**: Recommendation of against gathering that stops short of a formal mandate or restriction of gatherings. Includes uses phrasing such as "advises against mass gatherings" and "constituents should avoid gatherings of more than 100" that imply a recommendation versus restriction. Numeric limits, as imposed for indoor or outdoor gatherings, as well as for religious venues or gatherings, are listed under InGath and OutGath variables.      
      - **GathRestrict**: Restriction of gathering; includes formal mandate or an executive order that uses phrasing such as "prohibits all mass gatherings" (per definition of mass gathering) and "constituents must avoid large gatherings. Numeric limits, as imposed for indoor or outdoor gatherings, as well as for religious venues or gatherings, are listed under InGath and OutGath variables.         
       - **SchoolClose**: Formal closing of (at minimum) public schools. Where possible, additional information on types of school closings are provided in "PolicyCodingNotes".      
       - **RestaurantRestrict**: Restriction or limitation of restaurants and other venues where food is consumed on-premises. Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., restaurant closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are dining at at time).      
       - **OtherBusinessClose**: Mandate to fully close operations of any category of business. Coding a case as an other business closure requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "casinos must close", "operations at fitness centers and entertainment venues must cease by *date*"). A given state may have multiple cases of other business closures as they often occurred in phases (e.g., fitness centers and gyms on March 13, 2020; casinos and entertainment venues on March 15, 2020; personal service businesses like barbers and nail salons on March 19, 2020); thus, where possible, separate entries are provided for each mandate.    
       - **NEBusinessClose**: Mandate to close all non-essential businesses. Coding a case as a closure order requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "non-essential businesses are required to close", "non-essential businesses must cease operations by *date*"). Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential businesses, as they vary substantially by state.      
       - **StayAtHome**: Mandate for individuals to stay at home for all non-essential activities. Coding a case as a stay-at-home order mandate requires the executive order to using phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "must stay at home"); otherwise it is coded as 0 for the "Mandate" variable if it uses advisory phrasing. Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential activities, as they vary substantially by state. Shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders are considered to be equivalent.          
       -**Quarantine**: Quarantines mandated for people entering the state, requiring a period of self-isolation. Quarantines may be imposed on all people entering the state, out-of-state residents, or travelers from a particular state or city. Quarantine length and who is covered by the policy can be found in the "PolicyNotes" variable. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       -**TravelRestrictIntra**: Restrictions on travel within the state. These restrictions can be between cities or counties or within them. The "StateWide" variable reflects whether these restrictions are applicable to across the state (coded as 1) or only for local areas (coded as 0). This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       -**TravelRestrictExit**: Policies which prohibit residents of a state from leaving the state. These policies may have exceptions for essential businesses. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       - **TravelRestrictEntry**: Travel restriction mandates that limit non-residents from entering a given state. These policies may have exceptions or exemptions for essential businesses or their employees, and they may include restrictions for commercial lodging for non-residents. This policy type was added April 8, 2020.    
      - **CaseIsolation**: Policy that requires individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection (via testing) or suspected COVID-19 infection to self-isolate for a specified period of time, or when they no longer test positive for infection. This policy type may also include requirements for quarantine of individuals who have been identified as high-risk for developing COVID-19 due to their close contact to patients with confirmed or suspected infections, including sharing the same residence. This policy type is different from "Quarantine" in this dataset, which refers to policies that require self-quarantine for individuals entering a state from any or particular points of origin. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.    
      - **PublicMask**: Policy that requires individuals to wear masks or other mouth and nose coverings when they are outside their places of residence in the public. This policy type does not reflect requirements around mask use or other types of personal protective equipment mandated as part of business operations, either routine or under efforts to ease distancing policies to re-establish in-person operations of business establishments. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.    
      - **BarRestrict**: Restriction or limitation of bars, breweries, wineries, tasting rooms, and/or other venues where alcoholic beverages are consumed on-premises and sales of on-site consumption is the primary function of the venue (i.e., bars/bar areas contained within restaurants are coded within RestaurantRestrict). Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., bar closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are onsite at a time and physical distancing of 6 feet or more can be maintained between parties). This variable was added on July 6, 2020.     
- **Mandate**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied is a mandate (1) or is advisory or a recommendation (0). This is coded on the basis of the order's phrasing (e.g., "residents are advised to stay at home and avoid unnecessary travel" would be coded as 0 for mandate as a "StayAtHome" policy). This variable was added on March 30, 2020.   
- **StateWide**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied statewide (1), or whether the policy is only applicable to sub-state geographic areas (e.g., counties) or sub-populations within a state (e.g., individuals aged 65 and older).  
- **PublicMaskLevel**: Reflects the relative applicability of mask policies to the general public across settings. We are currently only applying these categorizations to mask mandates, not recommendations; we will consider this as useful in the future. This variable was added July 13, 2020. PublicMaskLevel groupings are as follows:    
  - **Mandate1**: These policies reflect a limited mask mandate, with fairly limited scope to the public (i.e., shared transportation services, certain types of stores such as retail, or in specified settings such as large gatherings where social distancing is not possible).    
  - **Mandate2**:  These policies reflect a broader mask mandate, requiring the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across sectors indoors or in enclosed spaces. This includes waiting in line to enter indoor spaces, as well as shared transportation.    
  - **Mandate3**:  These policies reflect mandates that require the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across indoor spaces, as well as outdoor settings where social distancing is not possible (i.e., at least 6 feet between individuals who are not part of the same household).
- **DateIssued**: Date of policy issuance. The date of signing of the policy document (e.g., executive order) was used wherever possible. Format is YYYYMMDD (e.g., March 16, 2020 is 20200316). Entries are not currently included for most non-statewide policies; this documentation is in-progress.  
- **DateEnacted**: Date of policy enactment: the date of when the policy would be enforced, per descriptions available in policy documents. The format is YYYYMMDD. Entries are not currently included for most non-statewide policies; this documentation is in-progress.  
- **DateExpiry**: Date of policy expiry, if or as provided in the policy issuance or executive order. This date is meant to reflect when the policy or order would be in effect until or unless additional action is taken to extend, amend, or halt its status. The format is YYYYMMDD. This variable was added on March 29, 2020.    
- **DateEased**: Date the policy is eased. This date is meant to reflect when a policy is eased, relative to its original mandate. This does not reflect the timing at which a policy is actively ended; instead, this reflects the timing at which original restrictions are no as strict or comprehensive without fully ending the mandate. The format is YYYYMMDD. This variable was added April 27, 2020.    
- **DateEnded**: Date the policy is ended. This date is meant to reflect when a policy is ended, particularly if it is halted or reversed prior to its expiry date. The format is YYYYMMDD.  
- **DateReexpanded1**: First date at which a previously eased policy is re-enacted or re-instituted in some manner. This does not necessarily mean a previous restriction or closure is fully in effect again; instead, it reflects when a state starts, at minimum, re-establishing some type of mandated restriction or closure (e.g., reducing capacity limits from 50% to 25%, requiring restaurants to end indoor dining while still permitting outdoor services) after the state began lifting restrictions. This variable was added on July 2, 2020.  
- **DateReeased1**: First date at which a previously expanded policy is eased again in some manner. This does not necessarily mean a previous easing or lifting of restrictions is fully reinstituted; instead, it reflects when a state starts, at minimum, to re-ease a restriction or closure after it was expanded (e.g., increasing capacity limits to 50% again after they were reduced to 25% as a re-imposed measure). This variable was added on August 17, 2020.    
- **PolicyCodingNotes**: Coder notes. Information on specific businesses closed, type of emergency declaration, potential exceptions, etc., are provided here. 
- **PolicySource**: Currently available source for each policy issued. Sourcing by hard-copy PDF _versus_ hyperlinks is in-progress.    
- **StateWide**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied statewide (1) or for local areas (0).   
- **LastUpdated**: Date of last update for the given state-policy observation. The format is YYYYMMDD.    
- **LastUpdatedNotes**: Coder notes on last updates. This reflects notable changes since the last update, especially if a date has been recoded (e.g., switching to coding orders enacted at 11:59 pm on date1 to date1+1 for its enactment timing) or the "StatePolicy" type has been amended (e.g., some initial coding of "NEBusinessClose" policies were applicable to non-essential in-person retail businesses only, not all non-essential businessess as defined by state). 

## State-level policy response: _BETA DATASET_ (introduced May 2, 2020)
This dataset involves the transition of each state over to each policy action linked by policy ids, which enables better tracking of how policies have been enacted, expanded, eased, or ended over time. Our current dataset ("USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv") will be maintained in parallel while we move each state over to this new format. Once that is complete, the BETA dataset will use the same file name as before. We will provide regular status updates. 

- **File**: "USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv". Prior datasets are archived with date stamps in the format of YYYYMMDD.  
- **PID**: Policy id, or the unique id for each policy action. PIDs are used to link policy actions - Extends, Expands, Eases, Ends, Depends - to each other. They are six characters, with the first two characters being the two-letter state postal code and the next four being numerical format with leading zeros (i.e., PIDs of AK0001, AK0002 for two separate policies in Alaska). The numbers associated with each PID do not reflect the ordering of policy implementation, nor do they reflect the total number of mandates enacted by a given state. Multiple policy actions can come from a single executive order, and some earlier policies received "later" PIDs because they were identified upon further review. Instead, they should be viewed as **unique identifiers** for the different types of policy actions taken, which then can be linked together over time as they are extended, expanded, eased, or ended.  
- **location_id**: State-level unique identifier per the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.  
- **StateFIPS**: State-level Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) code.    
- **StatePostal**: Two-letter state postal code.  
- **StateName**: State name.  
- **StatePolicy** : String variable of state policies, as described below:   
      - **EmergDec**: Emergency declaration; currently includes State of Emergency, Public Health Emergency, and Public Health Disaster declarations.     
      - **GathRecom**: Recommendation of against gathering that stops short of a formal mandate or restriction of gatherings. Includes uses phrasing such as "advises against mass gatherings" and "constituents should avoid gatherings of more than 100" that imply a recommendation versus restriction. Numeric limits, as imposed for indoor or outdoor gatherings, as well as for religious venues or gatherings, are listed under InGath and OutGath variables.      
      - **GathRestrict**: Restriction of gathering; includes formal mandate or an executive order that uses phrasing such as "prohibits all mass gatherings" (per definition of mass gathering) and "constituents must avoid large gatherings. Numeric limits, as imposed for indoor or outdoor gatherings, as well as for religious venues or gatherings, are listed under InGath and OutGath variables.       
       - **SchoolClose**: Formal closing of (at minimum) public schools. Where possible, additional information on types of school closings are provided in "PolicyCodingNotes".      
       - **RestaurantRestrict**: Restriction or limitation of restaurants and other venues where food is consumed on-premises. Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., restaurant closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are dining at at time).      
       - **OtherBusinessClose**: Mandate to fully close operations of any category of business. Coding a case as an other business closure requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "casinos must close", "operations at fitness centers and entertainment venues must cease by *date*"). A given state may have multiple cases of other business closures as they often occurred in phases (e.g., fitness centers and gyms on March 13, 2020; casinos and entertainment venues on March 15, 2020; personal service businesses like barbers and nail salons on March 19, 2020); thus, where possible, separate entries are provided for each mandate.    
       - **NEBusinessClose**: Mandate to close all non-essential businesses. Coding a case as a closure order requires the executive order to use phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "non-essential businesses are required to close", "non-essential businesses must cease operations by *date*"). Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential businesses, as they vary substantially by state.      
       - **StayAtHome**: Mandate for individuals to stay at home for all non-essential activities. Coding a case as a stay-at-home order mandate requires the executive order to using phrasing indicative of a mandate (e.g., "must stay at home"); otherwise it is coded as 0 for the "Mandate" variable if it uses advisory phrasing. Coding does not distinguish among states' classification of essential versus non-essential activities, as they vary substantially by state. Shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders are considered to be equivalent.    
       -**Quarantine**: Quarantines mandated for people entering the state, requiring a period of self-isolation. Quarantines may be imposed on all people entering the state, out-of-state residents, or travelers from a particular state or city. Quarantine length and who is covered by the policy can be found in the "PolicyNotes" variable. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       -**TravelRestrictIntra**: Restrictions on travel within the state. These restrictions can be between cities or counties or within them. The "StateWide" variable reflects whether these restrictions are applicable to across the state (coded as 1) or only for local areas (coded as 0). This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       -**TravelRestrictExit**: Policies which prohibit residents of a state from leaving the state. These policies may have exceptions for essential businesses. This policy type was added April 3, 2020.    
       - **TravelRestrictEntry**: Travel restriction mandates that limit non-residents from entering a given state. These policies may have exceptions or exemptions for essential businesses or their employees, and they may include restrictions for commercial lodging for non-residents. This policy type was added April 8, 2020.    
      - **CaseIsolation**: Policy that requires individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection (via testing) or suspected COVID-19 infection to self-isolate for a specified period of time, or when they no longer test positive for infection. This policy type may also include requirements for quarantine of individuals who have been identified as high-risk for developing COVID-19 due to their close contact to patients with confirmed or suspected infections, including sharing the same residence. This policy type is different from "Quarantine" in this dataset, which refers to policies that require self-quarantine for individuals entering a state from any or particular points of origin. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.    
      - **PublicMask**: Policy that requires individuals to wear masks or other mouth and nose coverings when they are outside their places of residence in the public. This policy type does not reflect requirements around mask use or other types of personal protective equipment mandated as part of business operations, either routine or under efforts to ease distancing policies to re-establish in-person operations of business establishments. This policy type was added April 25, 2020.    
      - **BusinessHealthSafety**: Policies or government-developed guidelines involving specific types of social distancing, sanitation and hygiene, disinfectant and cleaning, and employee protocols (e.g., temperature checks and symptom screenings before shifts start, use of cloth facial coverings during shifts, requirements for employees if they are ill) above and beyond standard business and health safety requirements for a given industry. These policies or protocols are often instituted in relation to easing prior business restrictions, and such easing of restrictions depends on the existence and adherence to these protocols. Subsequently, "BusinessHealthSafety" is often a policy that is linked via "Depends" for easing various restrictions. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.    
      - **SchoolHealthSafety:** Policies or guidelines that mandate or recommend certain sanitation or safety practices in order for school buildings or grounds to be open for in-person use by students or employees. Examples of such policies or guidelines include regular sanitation schedules; desk arrangement requirements; spacing or shift procedures for student classes, meetings, and meals; rules about facial coverings or face shields in classrooms; and so on. These policies must be outlined separately from any that apply to business sectors or workplaces. They are also often instituted in relation to easing prior SchoolClose policies, so that summer school and other programs may proceed under stages of reopening.Subsequently, "SchoolHealthSafety" is often linked via "Depends" to easing of SchoolClose. This variable was added on June 19, 2020.    
      - **BarRestrict**: Restriction or limitation of bars, breweries, wineries, tasting rooms, and/or other venues where alcoholic beverages are consumed on-premises and sales of on-site consumption is the primary function of the venue (i.e., bars/bar areas contained within restaurants are coded within RestaurantRestrict). Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., bar closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are onsite at a time and physical distancing of 6 feet or more can be maintained between parties). This variable was added on July 6, 2020.     
- **Mandate**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied is a mandate (1) or is advisory or a recommendation (0). This is coded on the basis of the order's phrasing (e.g., "residents are advised to stay at home and avoid unnecessary travel" would be coded as 0 for mandate as a "StayAtHome" policy). This variable was added on March 30, 2020.   
- **StateWide**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy applied statewide (1), or whether the policy is only applicable to sub-state geographic areas (e.g., counties) or sub-populations within a state (e.g., individuals aged 65 and older).  
- **SWGeo**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy is applied for all geographic areas in the state (1) or whether the policy is only applicable to sub-state geographic areas (e.g., counties). If SWGeo is coded as 0, StateWide will also be coded as 0. This variable was added May 2, 2020.  
- **SWPop**: Binary variable indicating whether the policy is applicable to the state's full population (1) or whether the policy is only applicable to sub-populations (e.g., individuals aged 65 and older, individuals with chronic and/or severe health conditions). If SWPop is coded as 0, StateWide will also be coded as 0. This variable was added May 2, 2020.  
- **Encourages**: Binary variable that indicates policies that seek to “reopen” or “ease” the rules on businesses, sectors, or kinds of activities despite the absence of any prior formal closure of that specific sector or activity under state policy. Policies labeled with Encourages==1 are treated as a public signal of encouragement for the specified sector or activity to resume. These policies do not link to formal prior restrictions. This variable was added on July 2, 2020.  
- **InGathLim:** Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0. This variable was added on July 30, 2020.  
- **OutGathLim:** Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0. If this value does not equal "InGathLimit" for the same entry, the prior gathering coding system included two separate entries to reflect these differences. This variable was added on July 30, 2020.  
- **InGathLimReligious:** Numeric limit for gatherings indoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for indoor weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable. This variable was added on July 30, 2020.  
- **OutGathLimReligious:** Numeric limit for gatherings outdoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for outdoors weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable. This variable was added on July 30, 2020.  
- **PublicMaskLevel**: Reflects the relative applicability of mask policies to the general public across settings. We are currently only applying these categorizations to mask mandates, not recommendations; we will consider this as useful in the future. This variable was added on July 13, 2020. PublicMaskLevel groupings are as follows:    
  - **Mandate1**: These policies reflect a limited mask mandate, with fairly limited scope to the public (i.e., shared transportation services, certain types of stores such as retail, or in specified settings such as large gatherings where social distancing is not possible).    
  - **Mandate2**:  These policies reflect a broader mask mandate, requiring the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across sectors indoors or in enclosed spaces. This includes waiting in line to enter indoor spaces, as well as shared transportation.    
  - **Mandate3**:  These policies reflect mandates that require the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across indoor spaces, as well as outdoor settings where social distancing is not possible (i.e., at least 6 feet between individuals who are not part of the same household).
- **DateIssued**: Date of policy issuance. The date of signing of the policy document (e.g., executive order) was used wherever possible. Format is YYYYMMDD (e.g., March 16, 2020 is 20200316). Entries are not currently included for most non-statewide policies; this documentation is in-progress.  
- **DateEnacted**: Date of policy enactment: the date of when the policy would be enforced, per descriptions available in policy documents. The format is YYYYMMDD. Entries are not currently included for most non-statewide policies; this documentation is in-progress. In the beta dataset, if a policy is eased, the date of easement would be considered "DateEnact" for that particular policy action and then the policy it eases would be listed under "Eases."
- **DateExpiry**: Date of policy expiry, if or as provided in the policy issuance or executive order. This date is meant to reflect when the policy or order would be in effect until or unless additional action is taken to extend, amend, or halt its status. The format is YYYYMMDD. This documentation is in-progress, as it was added on March 29, 2020 as a variable of interest.     
- **DateEnded**: Date the policy is ended. This date is meant to reflect when a policy is ended, particularly if it is halted or reversed prior to its expiry date. The format is YYYYMMDD. This documentation is in-progress.  
- **Extends**: Policy id (PID) that a given mandate or policy action extends. This usually means that the previous policy will be in effect beyond its previous expiry date. An example: AK0004, a restaurant restriction in Alaska, was issued on 20200317, enacted 20200318, and had an initial expiry date of 20200401. AK0020, which was issued on 20200327 and enacted on 20200328, has AK0004 under the "Extends" variable, reflecting that this policy is extended until the DateExpiry listed for AK0020 (20200411). If (or when in this case) AK0020 is extended by a new order, AK0020 would be listed on that policy's "Extends" (which was AK0033). This variable was added on May 2, 2020.  
- **Expands**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy expands. This can mean different types of expansions: a policy now covers more populations or locations (e.g., expanding a local stay-at-home order to being statewide); a policy now includes a longer list of business types that must close in-person operations; a policy is now a mandate versus recommendations; and so on. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.  
- **Eases**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy eases. This means that while a previous policy is not fully ended yet, its earlier restrictions or mandates are no longer as strong. This could involve relaxing bans on mass gatherings (e.g., now groups of 25 or more are prohibited, versus 10); easing closure mandates on certain types of businesses so that they can limited in-person services (e.g., only up to 50% capacity); moving a stay-at-home order to a recommendation versus mandate; allowing some in-person instruction to occur for certain schools; and so on. As we code more policies that ease restrictions, we anticipate this variable to be refined further and we will document updates accordingly. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.  
- **Ends**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy ends. This means that the prior policy or executive order has either been formally ended, rescinded, or repealed. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.  
- **Depends**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy depends on. To date this typically links to a "BusinessHealthSafety" policy or protocol developed by the government or governmental agencies that details health and safety practices for in-person operations amid the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. This variable was added on May 2, 2020.  
- **Joins**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy unites with more locations at the same level of restrictions or closures. This variable is used to reflect the "joining" of locations under a given phase of easing (or expanding); for instance, if 10 counties moved to Phase 2 one week and then another 5 moved from Phase 1 to Phase 2 one week later, Joins would be used to "unite" locations under the same level of eased (or expanded) restrictions or closures. This variable is _not_ used to join different groups of eased (or expanded) business closures; it is expressly used to reflect shifts in locations under the same types of restrictions or closures. This variable was added on July 6, 2020.  
- **PolicyCodingNotes**: Coder notes. Information on specific businesses closed, type of emergency declaration, potential exceptions, etc., are provided here. 
- **PolicySource**: Currently available hyperlink for each policy issued.  
- **PolicySourceID**: Name of the PDF source used for each policy. For policies or orders wherein a website page is the only available source, the page was converted to a PDF and saved under "source" on GitHub.
- **LastUpdated**: Date of last update for the given state-policy observation. The format is YYYYMMDD.    
- **LastUpdatedNotes**: Coder notes on last updates. This reflects notable changes since the last update, especially if a date has been recoded (e.g., switching to coding orders enacted at 11:59 pm on date1 to date1+1 for its enactment timing) or the "StatePolicy" type has been amended (e.g., some initial coding of "NEBusinessClose" policies were applicable to non-essential in-person retail businesses only, not all non-essential businessess as defined by state).    
- **UpdatingSource1**: Primary source for updating policies for a given state.  
- **UpdatingSource2**: Secondary source for updating policies for a given state.
