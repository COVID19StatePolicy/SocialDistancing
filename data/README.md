### December 3, 2020 (2:04 pm PST)
**_Dataset updates_**  
Today we introduce three new variables in both datasets: Curfew, CurfewStart, and CurfewEnd. Full documentation can be found under ~/codebooks from the landing page. In brief, these variables are meant to capture restrictions that are based on time, such as limited stay-at-home orders (e.g., requiring individuals to stay at home from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am) and early closures of businesses (e.g., bars must close by 10:00 pm). We have sought to capture these time-based policies since late November/early December 2020, but we are also actively working to capture past policies as well.

We have fully transitioned 22 states to the dataset format inclusive of levels of restrictions for businesses and schools, as well as variables that more directly reflecting what locations certain policies apply to. These states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin.

### November 5, 2020 (11:23 AM PST)  
**_Dataset updates_**  
Starting today, we have launched several updates for both datasets (as summarized below). Full documentation can be found under ~/codebooks from the landing page. New variables in both datasets include:
  - **BusinessRestrictLevel**: Reflects broad categories of business restrictions. This variable was introduced to better reflect the main differences in permitted business operations that have emerged over the course of the US COVID-19 epidemic: full closure ("FullClose"), curbside or takeaway only ("TakeawayOnly"), permission for in-person outdoor services only ("OutdoorOnly"), and permission for in-person indoor services ("IndoorAllowed).    
  - **SchoolRestrictLevel**: Reflects a broad categories of school closures and restrictions. This variable was introduced in an effort to better reflect the main differences in permitted school operations that have emerged over the course of the US COVID-19 epidemic: no in-person instruction or activities permitted ("NoInPerson"), some in-person instruction or activities can occur (e.g., hybrid model, on-campus extracurricular activities) ("LimitedInPerson"), and in-person instruction allowed ("InPersonAllowed").  
  - Under **StatePolicy**, we are now aiming to track requirements on employee mask use at businesses ("BusinessMask") and mandates for mask use for at least K-12 schools ("SchoolMask").
  
 Under the "BETA" dataset, we also now include **"AppliesTo"** to capture a string of locations to which a policy applies if it is a state-coordinated county policy (StateWide==0 & SWGeo==0) or if it is a travel restriction applied to specific states and the District of Columbia (StateWide==1). 

We have transitioned 4 states to this format: Idaho, Missouri, Montana, and South Dakota. This designation is reflected under "ReReviewed" coded as 1; states that have not yet been transitioned to this format have 0 under "ReReviewed." We are also continuing to update with new policies, though we are currently working through a bit of a backlog for some states (e.g., California, Colordao, Michigan, and Utah). We aim to get through these states as soon as possible; we appreciate your patience.

### November 2, 2020 (10:39 AM PST)
**_Dataset updates_**  
Starting today, we have transitioned from using "GathRecom" with Mandate==0 to "GathRestrict" with a Mandate==0 in both datasets. User feedback indicated that having a single gathering policy type and using applicable variables in the datasets. Helper code is available under ~/01_code to assist with this.

Starting on Thursday, we will be launching several variables to better capture variations in levels of business restrictions (e.g., fully closed, outdoor only, indoor services permitted), school closures, and how different policies to different locations (e.g., states under a given travle quarantine policy, state-coordinated county-level restrictions). Transitioning each state to this new format will not occur immediately due to the need to go through each previous policy and ensure its proper coding. We have variables reflecting when a state has completed this transition in both datasets, and we will seek to communicate updates as clearly as possible; updated codebooks will also be published on Thursday. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

**_Gathering updates_**
Starting today we have transitioned "USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv" dataset to a new system for capturing gathering restrictions. Below is the previously published summary of this update as it applied to the "beta" dataset. In recognition that this update may affect current uses of this dataset, we have included an R helper script (see "01_code" folder) to help translate this system back to the prior naming format for indoor and outdoor gathering if they differ. If you run into issues with this new system, please do not hesitate to reach out to the team.

_Previously posted content on the new gathering system_
In the last few months, gathering restrictions have evolved to reflect a combination of indoor and outdoor restriction limits, as well as explicit exceptions for religious gatherings. To better capture these variances in a given policy while balancing dataset parsimony, we are now using a system that captures specific numerical limits in four variables (described below), and we have removed numeric labels or designations of "Any" from GathRestrict. We also now include numeric limits for what was previously only GathRecomAny in the prior system. 

As an example: for a policy where all gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited (previously GathRestrict50), we now enter this value - 50 - in the corresponding "GathLim" variables: InGathLim (indoor gathering restrictions), OutGathLim (outdoor gathering restrictions), InGathLimReligious (specific limits on indoor gatherings or events at houses of worship or designated religious or spiritual activities), and OutGathLimReligious (specific limits on outdoor gatherings or events at houses of worship or designated religious or spiritual activities). Note that under this system, a "GathRestrict" policy where no gatherings, of any number, are permitted is coded as 0 for corresponding "GathLim" variables. If no numeric limit is provided, these variables are blank - the equivalent of GathRestrictAny. 

The new variables are as follows (and also detailed on the landing page):
- **InGathLim**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0.  
- **OutGathLim**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0. If this value does not equal "InGathLimit" for the same entry, the prior gathering coding system included two separate entries to reflect these differences.  
- **InGathLimReligious**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for indoor weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable.  
- **OutGathLimReligious**: Numeric limit for gatherings outdoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for outdoors weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable.  

An example of this new system in application is as follows:  
"_...indoor social and recreational gatherings as described in Executive Order No. XX, Section X are permitted for up to and including ten (10) people … However, religious gatherings are exempt … effective immediately, the 49-person limit on religious, spiritual and worship gatherings is raised for indoor gatherings to 25 percent of capacity of the indoor space or a maximum of 100 people, whichever is smaller, and to 150 people for outdoor gatherings..._" 

For this example, the policy would be entered as "GathRestrict" and 10 for InGathLim, 25 for OutGathLim, 100 for InGathReligious, and 150 for OutGathReligious. In the prior system, this would likely result in two separate entries (GathRestrict10 and GathRestrict25) with additional information in PolicyCodingNotes.

### July 30, 2020 (5:52 pm PST)
**_Gathering updates_**  
Starting today we have transitioned our "BETA" dataset to a new system for capturing gathering restrictions. In the last few months, gathering restrictions have evolved to reflect a combination of indoor and outdoor restriction limits, as well as explicit exceptions for religious gatherings. To better capture these variances in a given policy while balancing dataset parsimony, we are now using a system that captures specific numerical limits in four variables (described below), and we have removed numeric labels or designations of "Any" from GathRestrict. We also now include numeric limits for what was previously only GathRecomAny in the prior system. 

As an example: for a policy where all gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited (previously GathRestrict50), we now enter this value - 50 - in the corresponding "GathLim" variables: InGathLim (indoor gathering restrictions), OutGathLim (outdoor gathering restrictions), InGathLimReligious (specific limits on indoor gatherings or events at houses of worship or designated religious or spiritual activities), and OutGathLimReligious (specific limits on outdoor gatherings or events at houses of worship or designated religious or spiritual activities). Note that under this system, a "GathRestrict" policy where no gatherings, of any number, are permitted is coded as 0 for corresponding "GathLim" variables. If no numeric limit is provided, these variables are blank - the equivalent of GathRestrictAny. 

The new variables are as follows (and also detailed on the landing page):
- **InGathLim**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0.  
- **OutGathLim**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors. If no limit is provided, this variable is blank. If gatherings of individuals outside the same household of any number are prohibited, this is coded to 0. If this value does not equal "InGathLimit" for the same entry, the prior gathering coding system included two separate entries to reflect these differences.  
- **InGathLimReligious**: Numeric limit for gatherings indoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for indoor weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable.  
- **OutGathLimReligious**: Numeric limit for gatherings outdoors at houses of worship or churches, as well as other types of religious, spiritual, and worship gatherings. If a location has exemptions for outdoors weddings or funerals, these exemptions are noted in PolicyCodingNotes rather than reflected in this variable.  

An example of this new system in application is as follows:  
"_...indoor social and recreational gatherings as described in Executive Order No. XX, Section X are permitted for up to and including ten (10) people … However, religious gatherings are exempt … effective immediately, the 49-person limit on religious, spiritual and worship gatherings is raised for indoor gatherings to 25 percent of capacity of the indoor space or a maximum of 100 people, whichever is smaller, and to 150 people for outdoor gatherings..._" 

For this example, the policy would be entered as "GathRestrict" and 10 for InGathLim, 25 for OutGathLim, 100 for InGathReligious, and 150 for OutGathReligious. In the prior system, this would likely result in two separate entries (GathRestrict10 and GathRestrict25) with additional information in PolicyCodingNotes.

In recognition that this update may affect current uses of this dataset, we have included an R helper script (see "01_code" folder) to help translate this system back to the prior naming format for indoor gatherings; creating the equivalent with concurrent policy linkages for outdoor gatherings is in-proress. If you run into issues with this new system, please do not hesitate to reach out to the team.

We are now in the process transitioning "USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv" to the new gathering system; we will provide updates as this is completed, as well as corresponding code to help work across these two formats.

Today we introduce a new variable in both datasets: **PublicMaskLevel**. Its definition is below, as well, as on the landing page:  
- **PublicMaskLevel**: Reflects the relative applicability of mask policies to the general public across settings. We are currently only applying these categorizations to mask mandates, not recommendations; we will consider this as useful in the future. PublicMaskLevel groupings are as follows:    
  - **Mandate1**: These policies reflect a limited mask mandate, with fairly limited scope to the public (i.e., shared transportation services, certain types of stores such as retail, or in specified settings such as large gatherings where social distancing is not possible).    
  - **Mandate2**:  These policies reflect a broader mask mandate, requiring the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across sectors indoors or in enclosed spaces. This includes waiting in line to enter indoor spaces, as well as shared transportation.    
  - **Mandate3**:  These policies reflect mandates that require the use of masks or cloth face coverings by the public across indoor spaces, as well as outdoor settings where social distancing is not possible (i.e., at least 6 feet between individuals who are not part of the same household).

### July 6, 2020 (5:39 pm PST)
Today we introduce one new policy type and one new variable in the "beta" dataset ("USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv"): **BarRestrict** and **Joins**, respectively. "BarRestrict" has been broken out from previous policy entries for 22 states thus far, and we provide updates on its completion here and on the landing page. These additions' definitions are as follows:
- **BarRestrict**: Restriction or limitation of bars, breweries, wineries, tasting rooms, and/or other venues where alcoholic beverages are consumed on-premises and sales of on-site consumption is the primary function of the venue (i.e., bars/bar areas contained within restaurants are coded within RestaurantRestrict). Coding a case as a restriction requires a formal restriction on operations (e.g., offsite consumption only, limiting services to only take-away, delivery, or curbside drop-off) or mandate for substantially reducing operations (e.g., bar closure must occur unless 10 or fewer patrons are onsite at a time and physical distancing of 6 feet or more can be maintained between parties).  
- **Joins**: Policy id (PID) that a new mandate or policy unites with more locations at the same level of restrictions or closures. This variable is used to reflect the "joining" of locations under a given phase of easing (or expanding); for instance, if 10 counties moved to Phase 2 one week and then another 5 moved from Phase 1 to Phase 2 one week later, Joins would be used to "unite" locations under the same level of eased (or expanded) restrictions or closures. This variable is _not_ used to join different groups of eased (or expanded) business closures; it is expressly used to reflect shifts in locations under the same types of restrictions or closures.

Today we introduce two new variables: **DateReexpanded1** in "USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv" and **Encourages** in "USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv". These new variables are designed to better capture the evolving policy landscape in the US COVID-19 policy response. If or when these variables are updated in the future, we will provide updates here and on the landing page. The variable definitions are as follows:  
- **DateReexpanded1**: First date at which a previously eased policy is re-enacted or re-instituted in some manner. This does not necessarily mean a previous restriction or closure is fully in effect again; instead, it reflects when a state starts, at minimum, re-establishing some type of mandated restriction or closure (e.g., reducing capacity limits from 50% to 25%, requiring restaurants to end indoor dining while still permitting outdoor services) after the state began lifting restrictions.  
- **Encourages**: Binary variable that indicates policies that seek to “reopen” or “ease” the rules on businesses, sectors, or kinds of activities despite the absence of any prior formal closure of that specific sector or activity under state policy. Policies labeled with Encourages==1 are treated as a public signal of encouragement for the specified sector or activity to resume. These policies do not link to formal prior restrictions.

As of today we have added a new variable in the beta dataset: **SchoolHealthSafety**. The following definition is also provided on the landing page:  
- **SchoolHealthSafety:** Policies or guidelines that mandate or recommend certain sanitation or safety practices in order for school buildings or grounds to be open for in-person use by students or employees. Examples of such policies or guidelines include regular sanitation schedules; desk arrangement requirements; spacing or shift procedures for student classes, meetings, and meals; rules about facial coverings or face shields in classrooms; and so on. These policies must be outlined separately from any that apply to business sectors or workplaces. They are also often instituted in relation to easing prior SchoolClose policies, so that summer school and other programs may proceed under stages of reopening.Subsequently, "SchoolHealthSafety" is often linked via "Depends" to easing of SchoolClose.

### May 2, 2020 (12:27 pm PST)
We are pleased to release the initial version of our "beta" policy dataset, wherein each state policy action is linked through unique policy ids and whether they extend, expand, ease, or end previous orders or actions. Documentation of the beta dataset and its variables are on the landing page README; in brief, they correspond very closely with the current dataset and primarily include additional policy action variables (Extends, Expands, Eases, Ends, Depends) that then permit linkages via policy ids (PIDs) over time. 

**The first six states in this dataset are Alaska, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.** Many other states have been transitioned to this format as well, but we are currently double-checking their linkages before pushing them to externally-facing beta dataset.

**The beta dataset is titled "USstatesCov19distancingpolicyBETA.csv".** We are actively maintaining the current dataset in parallel as we transition each state over to policy ID-linked format. When this transition is complete, what is currently called "USstatesCov19distancingpolicy.csv" will be replaced by what is currently our beta dataset. We will provide regular updates on this process.

### May 2, 2020 (9:35 am PST)
**We are carefully tracking how states are easing particular distancing policies or parts of previously mandated policies.** To better capture the linkages between different policies and when they are actively being eased or ended (versus expiring), we are currently developing a "beta" policy dataset that explicilty links policy actions via policy IDs on extending, expanding, easing, and ending each mandate in response to COVID-19. This is being done alongside our current dataset. We aim to introduce later today or tomorrow for a subset of states, and continue maintaining both until the "beta" dataset contains all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

To date, we have captured the formal easing or ending of policies in the following states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming. We are prioritizing others with known actions to ease or end policies, and/or those that indicated upcoming plans to do so (e.g., Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia), and hope to include them soon.

Starting today, we added a new variable "DateEased." Its description is below, as well as on the landing page README file.  
- **DateEased**: Date the policy is eased. This date is meant to reflect when a policy is eased, relative to its original mandate. This does not reflect the timing at which a policy is actively ended; instead, this reflects the timing at which original restrictions are no as strict or comprehensive without fully ending the mandate. The format is YYYYMMDD.  

**We are carefully tracking how states are easing particular distancing policies or parts of previously mandated policies.** To better capture the linkages between different policies and when they are actively being eased or ended (versus expiring), we are currently developing a "beta" policy dataset that explicilty links policy actions on extending, expanding, easing, and ending each mandate in response to COVID-19. This is being done alongside our current dataset. We aim to introduce this in the coming days and will maintain both dataset until we can fully transition to the new one. The four states with formal easing of policies to date are Alaska, Georgia, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.

**_Variable updates_**  
Starting today, we added two categories under "StatePolicy": "CaseIsolation" and "PublicMask": Their descriptions are below, as well as on the landing page README file.    
- **CaseIsolation**: Policy that requires individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection (via testing) or suspected COVID-19 infection to self-isolate for a specified period of time, or when they no longer test positive for infection. This policy type may also include requirements for quarantine of individuals who have been identified as high-risk for developing COVID-19 due to their close contact to patients with confirmed or suspected infections, including sharing the same residence. This policy type is different from "Quarantine" in this dataset, which refers to policies that require self-quarantine for individuals entering a state from any or particular points of origin.  
- **PublicMask**: Policy that requires individuals to wear masks or other mouth and nose coverings when they are outside their places of residence in the public. This policy type does not reflect requirements around mask use or other types of personal protective equipment mandated as part of business operations, either routine or under efforts to ease distancing policies to re-establish in-person operations of business establishments. 

**We are also carefully tracking how states are easing particular distancing policies or parts of previously mandated policies.** To better capture the linkages between different policies and when they are actively being eased or ended (versus expiring), we are currently developing a "beta" policy dataset that explicilty links policy actions on extending, expanding, easing, and ending each mandate in response to COVID-19.

### April 24, 2020 (10:50 am PST)  
No state-level policy updates were made since April 23. We archived yesterday's file and pushed new one as we were alerted of issues with blank variables in the .csv file. Note no variables were missing in the policy dataset; rather, a step in our data processing and pre-GitHub data cleaning had not occurred.

- **Mississippi**: "StayAtHome" has been extended through 20200427. Note that some particular components of this mandate appears to have been eased since its original issuance. Our team is currently considering how to capture the important distinctions between the two ends of a mandate's status: fully extending its current expiry date and fully ending a given policy. Considerations include adding variables to reflect when and what parts of a policy are being eased. We will provide updates here and the landing page when these variables are added.

### April 13, 2020 (5:49 am PST)  
**_State updates_**  
Our team has begun a re-review of all existing policy records by state in an effort to cross-check sources, relevant dates (issuance, enactment, expiry), and policy coding (i.e., classification of each policy). Since our initial effort to capture state-level distancing policies (March 20-21, 2020), documentation has markedly improved as have online compilations of executive orders on government websites and elsewhere. The primary updates we see thus far are shifting dates by one day (e.g., re-review found that a policy was enacted at 11:59 pm on 2020031, so this was updated to 20200401 for "DateEnacted"), additional or amended gathering restrictions identified through document re-review (e.g., Utah's initial GathRestrictAny on 20200312 was revised to a non-statewide GathRecomAny following re-review of declarations and orders), and additional "OtherBusinessClose" mandates.  
  
As of today, we have completed the re-review of 23 states: Alabama through Hawaii, and South Carolina through Wyoming. All policy entries where "LastUpdated" is 20200411, 20200412, 20200413 and includes notes in the "LastUpdatedNotes" indicate an update to the prior entry.

**_State updates_**
- **Alabama**: "OtherBusinessClose" issued 20200327, enacted on 20200328. This was not coded as "NEBusinessClose" because it listed a subset of groups of non-essential businesses to close rather than issuing a full closure mandate and detailing exceptions.    
- **Arizona**: "StayAtHome" issued 20200330, enacted on 20200331.    
- **Connecticut**: Fixed typo for "StatePolicy": was "StateAtHome" now revised to "StayAtHome".    
- **Florida**: "NEBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200330 for subset of counties. StateWide==0.
- **Idaho**: "SchoolClose" issued and enacted on 20200323. This was previously not coded as a full school closure; re-review indicated that the soft-closure involved requiring all students to not attend school in-person and schools move to distancing learning, constituting a state-wide school closure.    
- **Mississippi**: "StayAtHome" issued and enacted on 20200331 for Lauderdale County only. StateWide==0.     
- **Mississippi**: "NEBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200331 for Lauderdale County only. StateWide==0.

- **South Carolina**: "OtherBusinessClose" issued and enacted on 20200331. Similar to the Alambama order, this was not coded as "NEBusinessClose" because it listed a subset of groups of non-essential businesses to close rather than issuing a full closure mandate and detailing exceptions.    
- **Tennessee**: "StayAtHome" recommendation (Mandate==0) issued on 20200330, enacted on 20200401. The order urges all persons in Tenneessee to stay at home rather than mandating them to do so, so this is not currently coded as a "StayAtHome" mandate.    
- **Tennessee**: "NEBusinesClose" issued on 20200330, enacted on 20200401.    


### March 30, 2020 (4:17 pm PST)
